# spoon-ui Roadmap

The spoon-ui roadmap communicates project priorities for evolving and extending the scope of the product. New product experiences and features will include changes in various layers of the product.

The spoon-ui team is currently focused on creating a secure document warehouse for enterprise use. We encourage the community to work with us to improve spoon-ui for these scenarios and extend it for others.

## Released Versions

## Upcoming Ship Dates

## Feedback

The best way to give feedback is to create issues in the [spoon-ui](https://github.com/Grindrodbank/spoon-ui) repo. 

Although mostly obvious, please give us feedback that will give us insight on the following points:
* Existing features are missing some capability or otherwise don't work well enough.
* Missing features that should be added to the product.
* Design choices for a feature that is currently in-progress.

Some important caveats / notes:

* It is best to give design feedback quickly for improvements that are in-development. We're unlikely to hold a feature being part of a release on late feedback.
* We are most likely to include improvements that either have a positive impact on a broad scenario or have very significant positive impact on a niche scenario. This means that we are unlikely to prioritize modest improvements to niche scenarios.
* Compatibility will almost always be given a higher priority than improvements.
